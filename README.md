This code can be used to generate simulations similar to Figs. 3-11 in the following paper:

Virginia Bordignon, Stefan Vlaski, Vincenzo Matta, and Ali H. Sayed,  "Learning from Heterogeneous Data Based on Social Interactions over Graphs,'' in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 2023.

Figs. 3 to 7 are generated executing file 'figures_3_7.py'.

Fig. 8 is generated executing file 'figure_8.py'.

Fig. 9 is generated executing file 'figure_9.py'.

Fig. 10 is generated executing file 'figure_10.py'.

Fig. 11 is generated executing file 'figure_11.py'.

Please note that the code is not generally perfected for performance, but is rather meant to illustrate certain results from the paper. The code is provided as-is without guarantees.
