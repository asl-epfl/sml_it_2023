Figs. 3 to 7 are generated executing file 'figures_3_7.py'.

Fig. 8 is generated executing file 'figure_8.py'.

Fig. 9 is generated executing file 'figure_9.py'.

Fig. 10 is generated executing file 'figure_10.py'.

Fig. 11 is generated executing file 'figure_11.py'.

Please note that the code is not generally perfected for performance, but is rather meant to illustrate certain results from the paper. The code is provided as-is without guarantees.
